                            <p><strong>You've been doing it all wrong.</strong></p>
                            <p>An idea strucks.</p>
                            <p>You start creating a website or product around it.</p>
                            <p>You launch it...only to find out that <strong>NOBODY</strong> wants it.</p>
                            <p><strong>It's a big mistake.</strong></p>
                            <p>It's why most people give up when pursuing their idea.</p>
                            <p>Don't get me wrong, your idea may be great but what's more important is: are there
                              actually people looking for it?</p>
                            <p>That's the big question.</p>
                            <p>&nbsp; </p>
                            <p class="subhead" align="center"><strong>Choosing The Right Niche Can Either Make Or Break
                                Your Success</strong></p>
                            <p>Now you might be wondering why the best niche is even a question. Isn&rsquo;t it just a
                              matter of looking at which niche is the most successful in terms of traffic and then
                              picking that one?<br />
                              <br />
                              There are many factors besides just traffic volume that are vital to consider. </p>
                            <p>More to the point though, even if you <em>did </em>just go with the most
                              &lsquo;popular&rsquo; topic, you would likely find this isn&rsquo;t as clear cut as it
                              should be either.<br />
                              <br />
                              Why? Well apart from anything else, many sites aren&rsquo;t so clear cut in their niche to
                              begin with. <br />
                              <br />
                              If you look at the most successful blogs across all niches then you have things like The
                              Huffington Post, Boing Boing, Techcrunch and Kottleâ€¦<br />
                              <br />
                              The biggest blogs aren&rsquo;t necessarily in the most popular niches when you look at
                              volume across <em>all </em>of the web and many bloggers don&rsquo;t openly share their
                              traffic stats anyway.<br />
                              <br />
                              Looking at a survey conducted through Warrior Forum, popular blog topics appear to include
                              the &lsquo;making money niche&rsquo;, the &lsquo;health&rsquo; niche, the
                              &lsquo;dating&rsquo; niche and the &lsquo;betting niche&rsquo;.<br />
                              <br />
                              But while the stats may not paint a clear picture of the &lsquo;most popular niches&rsquo;
                              what we keep repeatedly seeing in regards to this topic is just how important the choice
                              of niche is to your eventual success.<br />

                                Worth Pursuing</strong> </p>
                            <p>When you &quot;find a niche&quot;, you want to make sure:</p>
                            <p><strong>1. Is it a large enough niche? </strong>With not a large enough audience, your
                              efforts will be wasted.</p>
                            <p><strong>2. Is it profitable?</strong> Can you make money in your niche? There's no point
                              entering a big niche when there's no buyer intent.</p>
                            <p><strong>3. Is it &quot;content worthy&quot;?</strong> Meaning, will you ever run out of
                              content to share?</p>
                            <p>If you answered 'Yes' to all three, then you are in a winning niche!</p>
                            <p>If not, and if you don't even have a clue where to start, don't panic!</p>
                            <p>I created a step-by-step course showing you how to finally find your niche so you'll get
                              a higher chance of successfully launching your site, blog or product.</p>
